# Machine-Learning-Assisted-Toxicity-Prediction-of-Metal-Oxide-Nanoparticles
This notebook implements a comprehensive workflow for predicting nanoparticle toxicity from XRD-derived structural features. We use Pymatgen to generate a high-volume synthetic XRD dataset with controlled crystallite sizes, then build ML models to infer toxicity trends and guide safer nanomaterial design.
